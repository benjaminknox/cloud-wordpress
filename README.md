This repository provides a comprehensive Docker-based solution for deploying WordPress to various environments, this also contains a compose file for local development.  It streamlines the process of setting up, configuring, tracking, and managing your custom WordPress website using Docker containers. Designed for self-contained and custom WordPress solutions.

### Key Features
**Automatic wp-content Volume Updates:** The `entrypoint` bash script included in this repository is configured to automatically update the wp-content volume when a new version of the WordPress container is deployed. This ensures that your custom plugins and themes are preserved across container updates, simplifying the maintenance of your WordPress site.

**Intended for Source Control:** This boilerplate is designed to be a starting point with Git, making it easy to track changes to your custom WordPress site's `wp-content` folder themes and plugins.

### Details

- **Local Development with Docker Compose:** For local development, a Docker Compose file is available that sets up a complete WordPress development environment with MySQL. This allows for the quick creation of a local instance for testing, debugging, and customizing your WordPress site.

- **Start-Local Bash Script:** To simplify the local development setup, you'll find a bash script named `start-local` in the root of this repository. Running this script automates the process of starting the local development environment using Docker Compose. It ensures that all the necessary containers are up and running, ready for your WordPress development.
